# SYLIP-CORPORATION-PROJECT

Description:
In this project, an in-depth analysis was conducted on Sylip Corporation's sales data, spanning the years 2010 to 2017. The primary objective was to extract valuable insights using various key performance indicators (KPIs) such as overall profit across regions, annual revenue, total units sold annually, rate of total revenue achieved annually, average annual profit, count of item types sold in each region, and identification of the top four countries with the highest and lowest revenue. Additionally, a specific focus was placed on identifying the five countries with the lowest units sold below a benchmark of 50,000 units.

Skills:
The successful execution of this project necessitated expertise in data manipulation, advanced data analysis, and proficient data visualisation techniques. Proficiency in SQL Server, Excel, and Power BI was crucial for efficient data extraction, thorough data cleansing, and comprehensive data analysis. The ability to apply statistical and analytical methods to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets was a key skill.

Technology:
Excel served as the central hub for data storage and management throughout the project. SQL Server played a pivotal role in cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis. Power BI was employed for crafting compelling data visualizations that conveyed insights effectively to stakeholders. The project highlighted the effective use of technology tools to handle large datasets, conduct complex calculations, and present findings in an accessible manner.
